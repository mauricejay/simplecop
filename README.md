# simplecop
Created by ChatGPT. With how popular ChatGPT has gotten recently, I wanted to do an experiment to see how useful the AI tool is in coding. 
It turns out ChatGPT is impressively useful. Can generate code in an instant and also help troubleshoot failing code. 
I used it to create a quick and simple website, hence the name simple cop. It just a dummy site with a goal of being a marketplace for people to quickly buy new and used items from other people. Similar to Offerup or FB Marketplace.  
It's a  fully hosted and live website, simplecop.com. All mock data.
